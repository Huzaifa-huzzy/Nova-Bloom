# Quick GitHub Setup 🚀

Your project is ready to upload! Follow these simple steps:

## ✅ Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `mern-ecommerce` (or your choice)
3. Description: "Full-stack MERN e-commerce application"
4. Choose Public or Private
5. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README"
6. Click **"Create repository"**

## ✅ Step 2: Connect and Push

After creating the repo, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mern-ecommerce.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 🎉 Done!

Your code is now on GitHub!

**Your repository URL will be:**
`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mern-ecommerce`

---

## 📋 What's Already Done

✅ Git repository initialized  
✅ All files staged and committed  
✅ `.gitignore` configured (node_modules, .env files excluded)  
✅ Ready to push to GitHub  

## 🔐 Security Note

Your `.env` files are automatically excluded from Git. They will NOT be uploaded to GitHub, which is correct for security.
